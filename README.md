# BasicsOfInterferometry
Introductory material illustrating how interferometry works, as well as how images are generated from interferometry data.


# CASABasics
Examples of how to process interferometry data using CASA.     
Main concepts in notebooks: flagging, calibration and imaging


# CheatSheets
Interacting with newer telescopes may require the astronomer to use a variety of computer interfaces
and tools.
Here a couple of quick instruction references are provided, focused toward astronomy users.

(For the first time GitUser among us, please refer to
`CheatSheets/GitHub_for_astronomers/GitHub for Astronomers_ First Time Users.pdf` first)


# SolarBrightnessTemperature
A simple radio astronomy experiment that uses a digital TV satellite dish to measure and calculate the brightness temperature of the Sun.    
It introduces terminology and concept that are relevant for single dish radio astronomy.

The project was developed by Mike Gaylard from HartRAO (SA)


# WorkBooks
Some example workbooks from other telescopes
